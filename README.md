# IMAS Workshop Mappings

Skeleton mappings repository for usage at the UDA Mapping Workshop at ITER 20 - 22nd November

The test mapping files will be used to demonstrate the functionality of the JSON_mapping_plugin 
as well as giving participants a chance to try the mapping functionality

DRAFT data will then be mapped using the files here to ultimately map an IMAS magnetics IDS.
